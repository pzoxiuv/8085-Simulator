Building:

To build for Linux from Linux, simply navigate to the source directory and execute 'make all'.

To build for Windows from Linux, navigate to the source directory and execute 'make windows'.  If you have previously built a Linux version, you will have to remove the leftover object files either manually or with 'make clean' first.

Building from Windows is unsupported, as it would probably be very complicated.
