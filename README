Building:

To build for Linux from Linux, simply navigate to the source directory and execute 'make all'.

To build for Windows from Linux, navigate to the source directory and execute 'make windows'.  If you have previously build a Linux version, you will have to remove the left over object files either manually or with 'make clean' first.

Building from Windows is unsupported, as it would probably be very complicated.
