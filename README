Building:

To build for Linux from Linux, simply navigate to the source directory and execute 'make all'.

To build for Windows from Linux, navigate to the source directory and execute 'make windows'.  If you have previously built a Linux version, you will have to remove the leftover object files either manually or with 'make clean' first.

Building in Windows is not recommended and seems to be pretty complicated.  At the very least, you would probably need Mingw/Cygwin.

Running:

In Linux, run from the command prompt with ./sim.
In Windows, double click on the sim.exe executable.

Using:

Load a hex file with File->Load Program.  Then click the "Run" button to start running, or the "Step" button to start stepping.  

Double click on a line in the code view to set a breakpoint there, double click again to clear the breakpoint.  After reaching a breakpoint, click the "Run" or "Step" button to continue running or stepping through the program.

Once the program has finished running, press the "Reset" button and then "Run" or "Step" to begin executing the program from the top.

At any time you may press the "Stop" button to halt execution.

You may load another program at any time as well.  Doing so will halt the currently running program.
